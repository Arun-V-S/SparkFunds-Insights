## SparkFunds Investment - Data Visualization and deriving insights

The business objectives and goals of data analysis are pretty straightforward.

### Business objective: 
* The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments.
* The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.

### Goals of data analysis:

* **Investment type analysis**: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that Spark Funds can choose the type that is best suited for their strategy.
* **Country analysis**: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be Spark Fundsâ€™ favourites as well.
* **Sector analysis**: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors.
